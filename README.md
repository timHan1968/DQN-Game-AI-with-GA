# DQN Game AI

A human-level AI for the Atari Breakout Game but with mulitple balls, which makes the game significantly harder than the traditional single-ball version. Trained using a combination of DeepMind's Deep-Q Network and Genetic Algorithm. 

**File Description**

*DQN:*

"game.py": Source code for DQN training (without genetic algorithm)

"game_loss.py": DQN training (no genetic algorithm) but plots loss instead of score

"dqn.py": DQN and Memory classes

*Genetic Algorithm:* 

"game_ga.py": DQN code modified for GA usage

"genetic_algo.py": Source code for running the Genetic Algorithm

*Others:* 

"demo.py": Code for running a trained DQN model without training

"weights": Folder that stores an example trained DQN model

**How to Run**

For a demo of the AI, please run: "python demo.py" (though certain packages might need to be installed)
